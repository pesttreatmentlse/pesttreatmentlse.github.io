The chemical controls are used only after regular monitoring shows that a pest population had actually reached a financial threshold level.

<p>Chemical insecticides were to be utilized in the way least disruptive to biological control. After handling a number of nationwide chain exterminators and being mainly disappointed with the service, I relied on Terminators for help with pest issues at my place of business.
