<h3>Steps to Take Before Calling Pest Control Tustin CA</h3>
<p>Neighborhood IPM practitioners work to identify and fix pest-friendly conditions, getting rid of access to food, water and harborage by improving sanitation, maintenance, exemption and landscape management practices. The walking cane toad is another case illustrating biological control failure in this regard when it refused to hunt the target species and ended up being a pest itself.</p>
<p>Cover or eliminate bird cages and aquarium, and relocate other family pets before using aerosol (spray) pesticides. Ensure the person who will be using your pesticides holds a legitimate picture ID Pest Control Licence.

Planting potatoes well away from the previous year's crop prevents access to required food and the beetles will starve.</p>
