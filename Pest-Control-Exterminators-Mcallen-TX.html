Maybe biological control is most understood for importation of natural enemies, typically from the pest's location of origin, to control non-native pests (e.g., importing vedalia bettles to control cottony cushion scales which were attacking California citrus orchards).</p>

After handling a number of national chain exterminators and being mostly disappointed with the service, I relied on Terminators for assist with pest problems at my place of business. The concept of IPM is to keep an eye on and control pests just when they start appearing and removing the over application of pesticides in the living environmentWe are well versed with IPM techniques, Scope of works, application methods and industry specific record keeping treatments.</p>
