<p>A redirection of pest management is needed to incorporate year-round soil, weed, cropping, water, and associated practices at farm and neighborhood levels and to consider the effects of these practices on the overall fauna, dietary state, and balance of regional communities (16 ).

<p>Monitoring and identification minimizes the dangers of using the incorrect kind of pesticide, or utilizing pesticides when other strategies will be more reliable.
