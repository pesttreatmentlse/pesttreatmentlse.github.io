<p>New generation of GPS, sensors-fitted farm devices, e-tablets, and mobile applications (Plantix) might be utilized for future pests and diseases recognition and monitoring 47 Since application of IPM programs depends mostly on information, it is anticipated that a giant step being taken in locations such as concepts of insect sampling, computer system programming and mathematics, understanding of pests biological and environmental elements, and simulation strategies and modeling 11 Additionally, meteorological and geostatistical computer models can revolutionize forecasting and tracking of insect pests, which, ultimately improve decision-making for IPM.</p>
